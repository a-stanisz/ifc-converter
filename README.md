# IFC Converter
An attempt to create the simplest possible IFC Schema converter ðŸ¤ž

## Initial approach:
- Get and play around with static IFC Schema Version 4 in "EXPRESS" format.
- Try to extract and enumerate in the least possible tedious way the IFC Schema Types and define them as JSON Schema

## The IFC Schema to play around with:
- Version: 4.0.2.1
- Name: [IFC4 ADD2 TC1](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2_TC1/HTML/)
- ISO publication: [ISO 16739-1:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/70303.html)
- Published: 2017-10
- Current status: Official (as for 2022, November 18)
